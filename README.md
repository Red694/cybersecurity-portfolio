### Internal Security Audit – Botium Toys (Training Exercise)

**Context:** This exercise was part of the Google Cybersecurity training program. The scenario and initial risk assessment report were provided as part of the exercise.

**My Contribution:** I completed the **Controls and Compliance Checklist** based on the scenario, evaluating security controls, identifying gaps, and providing professional recommendations to improve Botium Toys' security posture.

### Network Traffic Analysis – Analyze Network Layer Communication (Training Exercise)

**Context:** This exercise was part of the Cybersecurity training program. A network traffic log was provided, and the task was to analyze DNS and ICMP traffic to identify connectivity issues.

**My Contribution:** I completed the Network Traffic Analysis Report based on the provided logs, summarizing the problem, analyzing the data, and providing recommended next steps. This exercise helped me consolidate my understanding of network protocols, traffic analysis, and incident reporting.

### Network Attack Analysis – Analyze Network Attacks (Training Exercise)

**Context:** This exercise was part of the Cybersecurity training program. A TCP/HTTP network log was provided, and the task was to analyze web server traffic to identify potential attacks affecting availability.

**My Contribution:** I analyzed the log, identified a SYN flood DoS attack from a specific IP, and documented how the attack impacts legitimate traffic. I explained the TCP three-way handshake, the effects of the attack on server resources, and how failed connections manifest in the logs. This exercise helped me develop skills in traffic analysis, incident reporting, and understanding denial-of-service attacks.

### Security Incident Report – Brute Force & Malware (Training Exercise)

**Context:** This exercise was part of a cybersecurity training scenario. A website was compromised via a brute-force attack on the admin panel, leading to malware being delivered to visitors. The scenario, logs, and background information were provided as part of the exercise.

**My Contribution:** I prepared a detailed incident report based on the provided scenario, documenting the sequence of events, identifying the key network protocol involved (HTTP), and recommending mitigation steps such as multi-factor authentication. This exercise helped me practice structuring professional incident reports, summarizing security incidents, and proposing effective remediation measures.

### Network Hardening – Security Risk Assessment (Training Exercise)

**Context:** This exercise was part of a cybersecurity training scenario. The organization had recently suffered a major data breach, and the task was to review the network, identify vulnerabilities, and recommend hardening measures to prevent future attacks. The scenario provided the vulnerabilities and background information.

**My Contribution:** I prepared a detailed security risk assessment report based on the provided scenario. I selected password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and port filtering as the main hardening tools. I explained how enforcing password policies prevents sharing and use of default passwords, how MFA adds an extra layer of protection, and how port filtering reduces the network’s attack surface. This exercise helped me practice writing professional risk assessments and recommending practical network hardening measures.
